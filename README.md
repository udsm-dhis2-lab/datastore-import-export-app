Interactive datastore import export tool based on DHIS2 platform aim at extending import and export capabilities for datastore contents

## Prerequisites

1. [NodeJs (10 or higher)](https://nodejs.org)
2. npm (6.4.0 or higher), can be installed by running `apt install npm`
3. git, can be installed by running `apt install git`

## Setup

Clone repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/hisptz/datastore-import-export-app.git
```

Navigate to application root folder

```bash
cd datastore-import-export-app
```

Install all required dependencies for the app

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start development server

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

This command will require proxy-config.json file available in the root of your source code, usually this file has this format

```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/",
    "secure": "false",
    "auth": "admin:district",
    "changeOrigin": "true"
  },
  "/": {
    "target": "https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/",
    "secure": "false",
    "auth": "admin:district",
    "changeOrigin": "true"
  }
}
```

We have provided `proxy-config.example.json` file as an example, make a copy and rename to `proxy-config.json`

## Build

To build the project run

`npm run build`

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`, this will include a zip file ready for deploying to any DHIS2 instance.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## How the app works:
The app allows transfer of namespaces between two dhis2 instances, both installed with the datastore import/export app. A file containing the data in json format from one instance is imported into the second instance for creation of new namespaces and updating existing namespaces.

## Ways to export.
One way is to check desired namespaces on the left most column. Once one or more namespaces are checked. An export button will become active and once clicked a file will be downloaded.
Another way is to click on the namespace on the left column. On the middle column above the list of keys an export button will be visible. Click on the button to download a json file with the namespace.
To import the file click on the import button on the left most column above the list of namespaces. Select the file that exported another instance then import it to your instance.

## Results:
The Datastore import/export application has been used in implementation of Bottleneck Analysis, Scorecard, and customized program dashboard configurations in national HMIS, Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Information System and District Case Monitoring System in Tanzania during migration of metadata configurations from development/training instance to the live systems.
